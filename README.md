## 📊 Digital Balance Analysis – Exploring Student Social Media Habits


![](https://)

## 🧩 Introduction
This project analyzes how students' use of social media affects their academic performance, sleep, and mental well-being. I used Excel for data cleaning, SQL for deeper analysis, and Power BI to build an interactive dashboard. The goal was to uncover patterns in behavior and suggest ways to promote healthier digital habits.


## 📏 Key Metrics
- Average Daily Social Media Usage (hours)
- Addiction Score
- Academic Performance (GPA)
- Sleep Hours per Night
- Mental Health Score
- Most Used Social Media Platform
- Impact on Academic Performance


## 🛠 Skills and Concepts Demonstrated
### Excel:
- Cleaned and organized raw data.
- Created columns like Addiction_Category and Performance_Risk.
- Used pivot tables to find early trends.

### SQL:
- Found platform trends among addicted users
- Ranked students by addiction score in each country
- Measured correlations between sleep and usage

### Power BI:
- Filters by usage category and academic level
- Created GPA vs. Addiction Score chart
- Created Sleep vs. Screen Time scatter plot
- Ranked most used platforms among stressed students
- Ranked Mental health scores by country

## 📊 Analysis

### Average Daily Social Media Usage:
A majority of students spend between 3 to 6 hours daily, with some exceeding 6 hours, indicating heavy usage habits.
  
### Addiction Score: 
Students with usage above 5 hours/day had significantly higher addiction scores (7+), suggesting a strong correlation between screen time and addiction.
  
### Academic Performance (GPA):
Students who used social media excessively (6+ hours/day) had noticeably lower GPAs compared to moderate users.
  
### Sleep Hours per Night:
Students who spent more time on social media also reported less than 6 hours of sleep, with heavy users averaging even lower.
  
### Mental Health Score: 
Mental health scores tended to decline as social media usage increased. High-addiction users reported more stress and lower well-being.
  
### Most Used Platform: 
TikTok and Instagram were the most used platforms among students with high addiction scores and disrupted academic performance.
  
### Impact on Academic Performance:
Over 60% of heavy users admitted that social media negatively affected their academic focus and outcomes.
  
### Usage Category (Light, Moderate, Heavy):
Most students were Moderate Users (3–6 hours), while a concerning portion fell into the Heavy User category (6+ hours/day).
  
### Country-Based Trends: 
Nigerian students had the highest average daily usage and addiction scores, with below-average sleep hours and higher academic impact.

## 🧠 Conclusions and Recommendations
### ✅ Conclusions:
- Heavy users sleep less and perform worse academically.
- TikTok is the top platform among highly stressed students.
- Undergraduates tend to have higher screen time than postgraduates.


## 💡 Recommendations:
- Promote screen-time awareness and digital wellness programs.
- Focus health campaigns on highly used platforms (like TikTok & Instagram).
- Target digital balance programs toward undergraduates.
