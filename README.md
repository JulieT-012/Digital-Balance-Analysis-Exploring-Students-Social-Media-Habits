# ðŸ“Š Digital Balance Analysis â€“ Exploring Student Social Media Habits

# ðŸ§© Introduction
This project analyzes how students' use of social media affects their academic performance, sleep, and mental well-being. I used Excel for data cleaning, SQL for deeper analysis, and Power BI to build an interactive dashboard. The goal was to uncover patterns in behavior and suggest ways to promote healthier digital habits.
